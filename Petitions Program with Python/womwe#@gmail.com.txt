Amazon India: STOP the sale of all fairness products
What will the world be like when Amazon decides to stand up for us? We will all live in a world free from discrimination based on color and caste too. A world where every individual will be valued only for who they are and for their qualities, skills, and capabilities. Only then will society truly progress as a whole.Sign and share #StopSellingColorism #CelebrateYou
