Increase health budget to 10% of GDP
Every life matters and we must invest in healthcare to create a robust system of primary clinics, polyclinics and tertiary care hospitals. We ask the government to increase expenditure on healthcare to 10% of the GDP in the upcoming budget and create functional centres of excellence in every district of the country.
