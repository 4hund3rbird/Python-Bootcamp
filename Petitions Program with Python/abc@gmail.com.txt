Legal recognition/ registration of Indian LGBTQIA+ marriages
In response to a series of PIL' s filed by multiple citizens seeking legalization of same-sex marriages/ LGBTQIA+ marriages under the Special Marriage Act of 1954 (SMA) and other on Foreign Marriage Act of 1969 (FMA), the Centre responded: “Nobody is dying because of the lack of marriage registration”. We, citizens, approach the court not because we are dying without a right, but because our living circumstances are atrocious without that right. LGBTQIA+ couples live in fear for most of their lives
