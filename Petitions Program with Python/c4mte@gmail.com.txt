#BeatTheBlues: GoK Ensure Mental Health Screening for Mothers During and After Pregnancy
Pregnancy is one of the most important phases in many women’s lives, and they deserve to enjoy it without the cost of their mental health. The first step to fighting this problem is screening. Screening women for their mental health during their routine visits to their Obstetrician-Gynecologist (OBG) will ensure that no one slips through the cracks. As first responders in pregnancy, the onus is on the OBG to screen women for their mental health and refer them to a mental health professional accordingly.
